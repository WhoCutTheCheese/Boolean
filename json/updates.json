Along with the docs explaining how each command works.*\n   **-** Ban modifiers do not exist for **!!ban**\n   **+ **Added **!!softban**\n   **+** Hidden legacy commands have returned :hypixel_wink:\n\n**-** __General Changes__\n   **+** Minor refactoring to make everything more consistent\n   **+** Bug fixes\n   **+** Stability improvements\n   **+** Added a maintenance system when necessary\n   **+** Added the **reason** command.

    "\n\n<:update:990097698667503696> **Boolean v2.0.0** | Rewrite\n> When transferring to slash commands only and resolving the command handler being unreliable I decided it was a good chance to rewrite Boolean as a whole.

More legit updates are in the works!",
