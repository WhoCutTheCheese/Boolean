# ðŸ”¨ Keep Your Server Safe ðŸ”¨ (BETA)
Boolean is a moderation bot for all your moderation needs. Boolean has a custom permit system made exactly for you and your moderations to have access to everything they need.
Boolean's moderation is quite simple, it is standard to all other moderation bots, just for you. Boolean saves punishment data is the form of cases, every punishment has a case, you can edit the case reason or delete it. Furthermore boolean keeps extensive logs on all the actions of your moderators to make sure they aren't abusing their powers.
*Note: Boolean's logging is for Boolean's command as of now, full audit logging is coming soon.*
**Note 2 Electric Boogaloo: This is the development branch, all changes here are subject to change and may be remove alltogether.**

##About Boolean

Boolean is a development project started by `TehCheese#1075` around **April, 21st 2022**. Well, Boolean as it's seen today was.
Boolean is the completed version of my other project `Grahmaham`. Grahaham's development started late 2020, mostly for fun to learn Node.js and discord.js.

If you're reading this Boolean's source code has gone public, despite having worked with discord.js and Node.js for well over 2 years now I can't imagine Boolean is the most optimized project.

##Issues
Feel free to present an issue here if you discover one, we will mark it an deal with it as soon as time comes up.
*Note: Issues will likely remain mostly unused as I am a single developer and I can straight up fix issues as they arise*

Boolean is segmented into two branches, the `production` branch strictly for the production version of Boolean and the `development` branch for all of Boolean's in-progress changes and bug fixes.

##Suggestions
Suggesting a feature for Boolean is quite simple, feel free to join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/G2EhQCZZfh) and use the `!suggest` command. Boolean developers will respond fairly shortly after telling you whether or not we will impliment it.
Suggestions will likely be added to our project board and marked with a priority as we may be working on bug fixes or new features. Your suggestion will likely end up lumped in with a feature update of many changes.

**Do not suggest bug fixes, upen a issue report on GitHub**

##Optimization
We are always looking for ways to make Boolean the best bot it can be, if that means some constructive critisism or suggestions for optimization changes, we are always open for feedback. Feel free to DM `TehCheese#1075` on Discord or any developer that is available.
